# 🛠️ Issue Board (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

A Kanban-style issue board built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — inspired by tools like Jira and GitHub Projects.

This is a **demo project** that uses **mocked JSON data** and local state. It simulates features like issue management, sorting, filtering, drag-and-drop, undo, role-based access, and polling.

🟢 **Live Demo:** [https://issue-board-app.vercel.app](https://issue-board-app.vercel.app)
